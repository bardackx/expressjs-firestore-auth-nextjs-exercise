# Quick notes

## Frontend

You'll need to create an `/liver-test-frontend/.env.local` file with the following entry

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/v1
```

That will be the url of your expressjs server

## Backend

You'll need to download `/liver-test/serviceAccountKey.json` from firebase console
